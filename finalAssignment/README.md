<b>Sensor Data Process</b>

I had a waterproof sensor to measure if my snake plant's temperature fluctuated.

It took weeks to actually get a variable set up on my Particle Console page as the sensor was pulling random temperatures or not pulling any thing at all.

In terms of the process of building my interface, I used the example code and built off of that. My interface design also used bar charts to measure the average temperature.

Due to the fact that I hadn't had a working sensor until recently, I decided to pull data every five minutes but create an average temperature bar every hour rather than everyday, so that I could get more readings. I also included an average mean line.

So far, the average temperature has remained the same for 25 hours...

I cannot say I was able to get any clear insight from my sensor data as the temperature did not fluctuate as I had hoped.

<b>Dear Diary Process</b>

For my Dear Diary assignment, I tracked things that inspired me for a full month. The types of inspiration fluctuated from art, architecture, food etc. My primary key is a string referring to a unique number. I did not experience much difficulty connecting to DynamoDB.

For my interface, I wanted to look at where most inspiration came from via the type category.

I definitely learned from this experiment that most of my inspiration came from architecture.

<b>AA Process</b>

I originally had zone 5. In a group, I was able to query all locations well with minimal errors.

For the interface I played around with the leaflet templates and settled on the one used now.

Due to my original query, I was not able to include pertinent information such as wheelchair accessibility. Therefore, this information does not come up on the pinned location.
